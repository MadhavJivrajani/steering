# Onboarding

This document covers steps needed to onboard new Steering Committee
members and off-board emeritus members.

- [ ] All new members must complete the [Inclusive Leadership Training].

- [ ] Update the following files in the respective repos:
  - [ ] [kubernetes/steering]: `OWNERS_ALIASES` and `README.md`
  - [ ] [kubernetes/community]: `sigs.yaml` and auto-generated content
  - [ ] [kubernetes/org]: `OWNERS_ALIASES` and the `steering-committee`
    GitHub team
  - [ ] [kubernetes/funding]: `OWNERS_ALIASES`
  - [ ] [kubernetes/kubernetes-template-project]: `OWNERS_ALIASES`
  - [ ] [kubernetes/k8s.io] - update steering@kubernetes.io and steering-private@kubernetes.io in `groups/groups.yaml`

- [ ] Add new members to the `steering-private` slack channel and
  remove emeritus members.

- [ ] Add new members to the CNCF Service Desk and remove emeritus
  members.

- [ ] Add new members to the [cncf-kubernetes-maintainers] mailing list.

- [ ] If a GSuite [top-level account] is owned by an emeritus member,
  transfer it to an existing member.

- [ ] If Zoom license credentials were owned by a majority of emeritus
  members, share them with exisiting members.

- [ ] Set up a private meeting to go over backlog.
